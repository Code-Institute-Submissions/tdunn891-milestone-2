# Milestone Project 2 - SpaceX Interactive Dashboard

## Project Purpose

This project aims to encourage the user to visually explore data relating to SpaceX's operations, including launches, payloads, etc.

## User Experience Design

#### Strategy
<!-- The reason for the product, application or the site, why we create it, who are we doing this for, why people are willing to use it, why they need it. The goal here is to define the user needs and business objectives. -->

<!-- Overall Strategy -->
UX efforts must fulfil the overarching strategy of the site. SpaceX runs an official API, detailing a wide array of data relating to its rocket operations. The strategic aim of the site is to present interesting data to the user, and make that data as enjoyable and intuitive as possible to explore. 


Site Objectives:

- Present SpaceX's launch and payload data in an intuitive and fun way.
- Promote interest in SpaceX's operations.

User Needs:

The target audience is spaceflight and SpaceX enthusiasts.

These users should be able to:

- Interact with SpaceX's launch and payload data.
- Derive new insights from this data.
- Be presented with pertinent external links (Youtube, Wikipedia, News Articles).

The following Opportunities/Problems table was used to determine which strategic priorities the UX efforts should address (in this order):

| Opportunity/Problem                           | Importance     | Viablility/Feasibility  |
| --------------------------------------------- |:--------------:|:-----------------------:|
| A. Display launch and payload data to the user| 5 | 5 |
| B. Allow interactive filtering of data        | 5 | 5 |
| C. Display underlying filtered data in a table| 4 | 5 |
| D. Instill a sense of excitement about future SpaceX launches | 3 | 3 |
| E. | | |

#### Scope
<!-- Defines the functional and content requirements. What are the features, and content contained in the application or product. The requirements should fulfill and be aligned with the strategic goals. -->

##### Functional Specifications

In considering the functional specifications, I researched existing graphical implementations of the SpaceX API. There is a vast array of data available from SpaceX (13 different endpoints), so it was important to scope in only the most engaging and interesting insights, while at the same time ensuring the data was also accessible to users with only minimal knowledge of SpaceX. Dashboards by their nature can (if implemented poorly) cognitively overload the user, making the functional scope a key consideration in this context.

Feature Set:

- Interactive dashboard of past SpaceX launches
- Show details of upcoming launch
- Interactive dashboard of SpaceX's payload data
- The current speed and location of the Tesla Roadster car which Elon Musk launched into space.

##### Content Requirements

<!-- What is required to provide value? -->

In order to provide the value of the above features, the following content is required:

- Interactive dc.js charts (stacked bar charts, pie chart, row chart).
- Data table dc.js showing further detail of the currently selected launches.
- Icons to visually aide the user.
- Embedded Google Map showing the launch site of the next launch (eg Cape Canaveral).
- 'Add to Calendar' button to add next launch to user's calendar (Google, Microsoft Calendar etc).
- Images of mission patches of past missions.
- Bootstrap image carousel to show images of the Telsa Roadster.

#### Structure
<!-- Defines how user interact with the product, how system behave when user interact, how itâ€™s organized, prioritized, and how much of it.  -->

##### Interaction Design

<!-- Patterns and sequences that provide options to the user -->
<!-- Good Int. Design:
helps people to accomplish their goals.
effectively communicates interactivity and functionality(what user can do).
informs user about state changes(file has been saved, or any feedback), while they interact.
prevents user error or mistakes, like the system asks user to confirm potentially harmful action(i.e. deletion). -->

The strategic goals of the site rests largely on the user's willingness to interact with the charts to find insights. The advantage of a dashboard is being able to view many different dimensions or views of a dataset at the same time. To this end, a single-page structure is most appropriate. For example, on desktop screen sizes, this structure allows all four charts in the Launch Explorer section to be viewed at once. The user is able to see the effects their filtering has to all four charts at once. For mobile and tablet screens, the navigation bar collapses into a toggler to allow jumping to each section. A 'Reset' button is provided which allows a convenient way to reset filters on all charts.

Consistency & Predictability:

The following icons were used to give visual cues as to what the section was about:
(Launch Explorer: rocket flying icon, Next Launch: rocket on launch pad icon, Payload Analysis: satellite icon)

Feedback:

<!-- Navigation and social links change colour on hover, which shows users that they are clickable. The Enquiry user form requires that all fields (Name, Email, Enquiry) are populated, and alerts the user to any fields which require attention e.g. an email address without a '@' symbol. Once the submit button is clicked, a modal is shown to provide feedback to the user that their enquiry was sent successfully. -->

Given the many possible interactions available to the user on the site, the following feedback mechanisms were employed to encourage as much interaction as possible:

- Tooltips are used on mouse over of all charts, giving some brief context to each chart's meaning.
- Tooltips also activate on mouse over of chart segments, giving additional detail of the segment.
- Slight colour fade occurs on mouse over of each colour segment within each chart. Cursor also changes to a hand icon to signal clickability.
- Colour transition on hover shows links icons are clickable.


##### Information Architecture

<!-- Organisation, arrangement and priority of content -->
<!-- Given the content requirements, It defines the arrangement of content elements, how they are organized, to facilitate human understanding. -->
<!-- Good Info. Arch:
organizes, categorizes, and prioritizes the information based on user needs and business objectives.
makes it easy to understand and move through information presented.
flexible to accommodate growth and adapt to change.
appropriate for the audience. -->

The organising principle and order of the content is structured to ensure the user understands and engages with each chart and section. The most engaging and easy to understand content - 'Launches By Rocket' - is located the top left of the page where the eye will naturally land first. The next chart - 'Launch Success' -features simple, intiuitive two bar chart - green: success, red: failure. Once this foundational understanding is achieved, the user will realise that the colours representing the rocket names are synchronised across the the next 2 charts - 'Launches By Year' and 'Launches By Site'.

#### Skeleton
<!-- Interface Design: The best arrangement and visual presentation of elements 
Navigation Design: Intuitive and completion of tasks  -->
<!-- Concered with What form will application take, how will users get around how will we present the content? -->

##### Wireframes

Two sets of wireframes were created in the early development stage to help setout the content and layout in differing device sizes. 

<!-- [Mobile Wireframes](Mobile_Wireframes.jpeg) -->

<!-- [Desktop Wireframes](Desktop_Wireframes.jpeg) -->

#### Surface

Colours: A dark colour theme was employed to give the user a sense of outer space.
Fonts: A futuristic typeface was employed for the section headings and chart titles to convey an exciting and sci-fi feel of spaceflight.

### User Stories
